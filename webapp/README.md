# SbDigitalLibrary

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.  The current default mode is to run in standalone mode.

Run `npm run start-standalone` instead to start the app in standalone mode, which replaces the live data service with a mock data api service.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project for production.

Run `npm run build-standalone` to build the project in standalone mode.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) and watch for changes.

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) once only.

By default, the unit tests will run using the Chromium headless browser.  To run in a different browser, update the `karma.conf.js`.

AblePlayer has an issue: https://github.com/ableplayer/ableplayer/issues/436
This cause the player to grow vertically every time the player is made full
screen and then returned to size. The code in the distribution file has a
‘fix’. It a quick fix that works in all the places T4T is using it. Check
the issue if it’s resolved.

If you need to update to a new version of able player, this will need to be
retested and the ‘fix’ may need to be reapplied.

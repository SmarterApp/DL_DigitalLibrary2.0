          summary: 'This professional learning activity was created for the State Network of Educators 2018 Winter Workshop to calibrate a shared understanding of the formative assessment process. By using five different chat stations with multiple entry points into the formative assessment process, educators energetically reviewed data, watched and discussed videos, shared technology strategies, prepared an elevator speech, and reviewed expert text. The engagement and focus in this timed activity produced multiple shifts in thinking and provided educators with a renewed energy to embed student success criteria and opportunities for authentic feedback into instructional lesson planning.',

    summary: 'This lesson uses students\' prior experiences with graphical representations of systems to facilitate their understanding of solving systems algebraically. In this lesson, students will continue to engage with systems of equations where both equations are in the form y = mx + b. Students will graduate to other types of system structures. They will learn that examining structures is a good first step since it is sometimes possible to recognize an efficient method for solving the system through observation. Students realize that if at least one of the equations has a single variable isolated, then that expression can be substituted into the other equation to get a single equation in one variable. Finally, students use the structure of a system of equations to reason about its lack of solutions.',

By using five different chat stations with multiple entry points into the formative assessment process, educators energetically reviewed data, watched and discussed videos, shared technology strategies, prepared an elevator speech, and reviewed expert text. The engagement and focus in this timed activity produced multiple shifts in thinking and provided educators with a renewed energy to embed student success criteria and opportunities for authentic feedback into instructional lesson planning.',
